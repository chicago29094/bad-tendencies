You are the band member for the rock band Bad Tendencies. Your job is to get the band members on stage and to keep them out of trouble. If you get close to a band member they will follow you to the stage, unless they are distracted or under the influence. You can collect money as you move along, otherwise the band members will grab it and likely waste it to support their Rock-n-Roll lifestyle. Use the keyboard arrow keys to move around. Good Luck!!!.

## Lessons Learned/Ongoing Issues:
### Lessons Learned
  - Collisions are difficult to handle in the standard DOM.  Canvas could work better for drawn animations.
  - Spacing and alignment issues can be challenging on complex layouts.
  - It is difficult to decide how much functionality should be added within class methods versus utility functions in the main code.
  
 ### Ongoing Issues
  - try / catch blocks should be added to critical bits of code that can stop the execution of the game
  - The intelligence of the computer controlled band members isn't great.  Their motion algorithm should be improved.
  - Sound is needed for the project and interactions
  - Playfield objects need to be added
  - Fighting among band members needs to be added
  - The choice of 2 players needs to be added, allowing players to take turns.
  - The game is gender specific.  Female characters should and can be added.
  - The scoring mechanism needs to be expanded.
  - A keyboard-based pause feature should be added.
  - The game has the capability of allowing guns and shooting.  That feature can be added on updates.
